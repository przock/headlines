** Building
To build simply run:
#+begin_src bash 
git clone https://gitlab.com/pluskale/headlines && cd headlines && cargo build
#+end_src

*** Nix
Cargo doesn't always like building certain things on NixOS because of it's unique packaging system

To fix this issue I've included a default.nix file that should make Cargo happy

to build on NixOS run:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/pluskale/headlines && cd headlines && nix-build
#+end_src
** Using 
If you run headlines without the ~NEWSAPI_KEY~ env-var set it will panic (and screw up your terminal, this will be fixed in 0.3)

To use headlines you must set ~NEWSAPI_KEY~ to a valid newsapi api key

Generate a key at [[https://newsapi.org/][the newsapi website]]

** Features
- The option to only get news from sources that make you happy
- A TUI Interface for viewing the latest news headlines
 + Scroll through the titles to see:
  + Sources
  + Summary
  + A link to the full article 
  + The full content of the article :: If it's supported by the source

** The Config File
The default config file can be found in examples/headlines.toml

If headlines is run without a config file it will use the defaults and generate an empty one at ~$HOME/.config/headlines/headlines.toml~

Presently the config file is very simple with just 2 fields:
#+begin_src toml
[tui]
ratio = 45

[api]
sources = "bbc-news"
#+end_src
~ratio~ defines the ratio of space allocated to the headlines of the articles to the information of the articles

The value you give here will be the % value of the screen space allocated to the headlines

~sources~ defines the sources that newsapi will pull from to show you news

It should be a comma separated list:
#+begin_src toml
sources = "bbc-news, abc-news, espn"
#+end_src
These are the possible sources:
